### What is Gametime?

Gametime is a really simple, really good app for keeping track of NFL games. I had the idea to finally make a football app worth using after spending Thanksgiving playing with my family. My initial build was made in about 5-6 hours entirely during Thursday (and 90% during the football games themselves, considering the commercials were 90% of each gameâ€¦).

### Why make Gametime?

Gametime was built for myself. Its primary purpose is not commercial nor competitive; I simply found myself getting headaches using every other app in the market. Once I discovered the NFL Fantasy API is rather open it became an issue of _when_ rather than _why_ (although I am still awaiting a response email letting me in directly).

### What are your plans for Gametime?

The current backend, besides the static team data, is completely supplied by [fantasydata](https://fantasydata.com) JSON. The suite of fantasy features that Gametime requires to be functional is still not present - in the Thanksgiving build it is only possible to get season or week-based stats for NFL games. There is no long-term storage besides static dictionary disk IO, so long requests might stack up fast when browsing through teams and material, without any real reuse. In addition, CBS/FOX/ESPN/NFL/Yahoo/etc each have their own apps (and it's because of them I have the API I do, I bet), none of which I desire to wage war with in any way.

So, the future of Gametime is purely personal, for now. I'm going to keep working on it in my off time, particularly during football games, but besides that, everything's staying low-key.

Enjoy!
